Besides PEP8 Naming Styles(http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions),
this document states the naming style on Django models.

For models with ManyToManyField, the field name should be a plural noun, 
and its realated_name should be given explicitly, which is in the form of plural noun.

When naming a view, 
if a view is resposible for presenting some pages, the name of view should be in form of
"description_page";
if a view is for taking some actions, i.e, to remove a user from group and redirect to group
management page, the name of view shold be in form of "utility", without "_page" as its postfix.

In the "views.py", the first line should always be
"from __future__ import unicode_literals",
in order to use unicode as default.
The following import statement should be classify into serveral groups:
# django dependency
# auth dependency
# model 
# form
# decorator
# util
# python library


When it is nessary to define a variable to represents a set of object, the name of 
that vairable should be in the form of "cls_set", while cls is the type of that variable.
